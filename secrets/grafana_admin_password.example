# Grafana Admin Password

This file contains the Grafana admin password for local/docker-compose deployments.

## Setup Instructions

1. Copy this file to `grafana_admin_password` (without the `.example` extension):
   ```bash
   cp secrets/grafana_admin_password.example secrets/grafana_admin_password
   ```

2. Edit the file and replace with a strong password:
   ```bash
   echo "your-strong-password-here" > secrets/grafana_admin_password
   ```

3. Ensure you also set the admin username in `secrets/grafana_admin_user`

4. Restart Grafana to apply changes:
   ```bash
   docker compose restart grafana gateway
   ```

## Password Requirements

For security, use a strong password that:
- Is at least 12 characters long
- Contains a mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and special characters
- Is unique and not used elsewhere

Example of generating a secure password:
```bash
# Linux/macOS
openssl rand -base64 32 | tr -d '\n' > secrets/grafana_admin_password

# Or use a password manager to generate a secure password
```

## Rotating Credentials

To rotate the admin password:
1. Update this file with the new password
2. Restart Grafana: `docker compose restart grafana gateway`
3. Log in with the new credentials at http://localhost:8080/grafana/

## Azure Deployments

For Azure deployments, Grafana admin credentials should be stored in Azure Key Vault.
See `infra/azure/README.md` and `documents/runbooks/grafana-credential-rotation.md` for details.

## Security Notes

- Never commit actual passwords to version control
- Use strong, unique passwords (minimum 12 characters)
- Change default passwords immediately after first deployment
- Consider using a password manager to generate and store passwords
- For production, use Azure Key Vault or another secrets management solution
- Rotate passwords regularly (every 90 days recommended)
