# Grafana Admin Username

This file contains the Grafana admin username for local/docker-compose deployments.

## Setup Instructions

1. Copy this file to `grafana_admin_user` (without the `.example` extension):
   ```bash
   cp secrets/grafana_admin_user.example secrets/grafana_admin_user
   ```

2. Edit the file and replace with your desired admin username:
   ```bash
   echo -n "admin" > secrets/grafana_admin_user
   ```

3. Ensure you also set the admin password in `secrets/grafana_admin_password`

4. Restart Grafana to apply changes:
   ```bash
   docker compose restart grafana gateway
   ```

## Default Value

For local development, the default admin username is typically `admin`.

## Rotating Credentials

To rotate the admin username:
1. Update this file with the new username
2. Restart Grafana: `docker compose restart grafana gateway`
3. Log in with the new credentials at http://localhost:8080/grafana/

## Azure Deployments

For Azure deployments, Grafana admin credentials should be stored in Azure Key Vault.
See `infra/azure/README.md` and `documents/runbooks/grafana-credential-rotation.md` for details.

## Security Notes

- Never commit actual credentials to version control
- Use strong, unique passwords
- Change default credentials immediately after first deployment
- For production, consider using Azure Key Vault or another secrets management solution
