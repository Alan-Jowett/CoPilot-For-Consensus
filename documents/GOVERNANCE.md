## Decision-Making Process

*   **Consensus:** Decisions are made through open discussion; maintainers aim for agreement before merging significant changes.
*   **Voting:** If consensus cannot be reached, maintainers may call for a simple majority vote among core maintainers.

## Release Management

*   **Versioning:** Semantic Versioning (SemVer) will be used.
*   **Release Cadence:** Regular releases for stable features; patch releases for critical fixes.
*   **Changelog:** Maintainers will maintain a clear changelog for each release.

## Conflict Resolution

*   Conflicts should be addressed through respectful discussion.
*   If unresolved, maintainers will mediate and make a final decision.

***

## Transparency

*   All decisions, proposals, and discussions will be documented in GitHub Issues or Discussions.
*   Meeting notes (if any) will be published in the repository.

## Future Governance Goals

**This governance model is inspired by OSS best practices and the principles of open collaboration.**
