Hi everyone,

I've been reviewing draft-ietf-quic-transport-34 and think we should
discuss the connection migration approach. The current design has some
interesting implications for mobile clients.

What are your thoughts?

Good point Alice. I agree this needs more discussion. Also, RFC 9000
provides some relevant context on path validation.

I've implemented this in our test environment. The performance results
are promising. See draft-ietf-quic-recovery-34 for related work on
loss detection.

We should coordinate with the HTTP/3 working group on this.

Starting a new thread on TLS integration.

I noticed some edge cases in draft-ietf-tls-esni-13 that might
affect our implementation. Has anyone else run into issues with
encrypted client hello?

Best regards,
Alice

Yes, we've seen this too. The spec in RFC 8446 is clear but
implementation is tricky. I recommend reviewing the test vectors
in the appendix.

Hello all,

I'd like to propose some changes to HTTP/3 prioritization based on
our production experience. This builds on draft-ietf-httpbis-priority-12.

Key points:
1. Urgency parameter handling
2. Incremental updates
3. Priority tree maintenance

Looking forward to your feedback.

Emma, this looks great!

We've been working on similar issues. Have you considered the
interaction with QPACK (RFC 9204)? The header compression might
affect priority signals.

Best,
Frank

Good catch, Frank. We should also look at draft-ietf-quic-qpack-21
for the latest updates. Our test suite covers these interactions.

Charlie, thanks for sharing the performance results.

I've been doing some analysis and think we need to update our
implementation based on the latest draft-ietf-quic-transport-34.
The NAT rebinding behavior is particularly important.

Should we schedule a call to discuss?

Quick question for the group:

In draft-ietf-quic-version-negotiation-13, section 5.2 discusses
compatible version negotiation. I'm unclear on the retry behavior
when incompatible versions are detected.

Can someone clarify the expected behavior per RFC 9000?

Thanks,
Ivan
