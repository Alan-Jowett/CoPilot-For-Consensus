# Allowlist for direct OS environment variable access in service runtime code.

# Format:
#   path/to/file.py                    - Allow entire file
#   path/to/file.py:regex_pattern      - Allow only lines matching regex

# Use this sparingly! Direct env var access bypasses schematized configuration.
# Only add entries for:
# - Backward compatibility fallbacks (with migration plan)
# - Infrastructure integration that cannot use config (e.g., Docker health checks)
#
# Each entry should have a comment explaining why it's needed.

# Backward compatibility: Legacy INGESTION_SOURCES_CONFIG_PATH env var fallback.
# TODO: Remove after migration period (when all deployments use config.service_settings.sources_file_path)
